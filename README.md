# Predicting Boston Housing Prices
Project part of Udacity Nanodegree

Topics that are covered in this project are:
a) Data Exploration - Exploring the statistics of the housing price data
b) Feature Exploration - To dive a bit deeper int our data, we are using three features from the Boston housing dataset: 'RM', 'LSTAT', and 'PTRATIO'
c) Model Development - In model development first I have defined a performance metric, then checked Goodness of Fit. Then the data is shuffled and split into training and test dataset.
d) Model Evaluation - Based on learning curve and model complexity, the model hyperparameters were tuned using GridCVSearch and a final model is selected.
e) Predictions - Final predictions on the house price is calculated based on certain inputs.
f) Conclusion - A conclusion is drawn in the end which tells if this predictions can be used in reality. The limitations are discussed in it.

I hope you'll find this project intersting :)
